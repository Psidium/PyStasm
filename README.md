# PyStasm
Python wrapper around the Stasm library.
## Description
[Stasm](http://www.milbo.users.sonic.net/stasm/) is a C++ software library for finding features in faces. PyStasm is a library wrapper with simplified Pythonic syntax using the Python C API built on top of [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) and [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/). For example, to get a list of facial landmarks from an image:
```python
import cv2, stasm
img = cv2.imread(imgpath, cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
landmarks = stasm.search_single(img)
```
A full Python version of the minimal Stasm C++ [example](http://www.milbo.users.sonic.net/stasm/minimal.html) is located in the [documentation](http://pythonhosted.org/PyStasm).
## Requirements
* Python (tested on 2.7, 3.4)
* numpy >= 1.7
* [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) (3.0 or newer required for Python 3)

## Installation
The recommended way to install PyStasm is through [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi):
```
$ pip install PyStasm
```
To build from source, make sure you have the OpenCV headers and libraries in your include/library paths and then run:
```
$ python setup.py install
```
## Documentation
For information specific to this wrapper, take a look at the PyStasm [API reference](http://pythonhosted.org/PyStasm). For further information about Stasm consult the [user manual](http://www.milbo.org/stasm-files/stasm4.pdf). To build the PyStasm docs:
```
$ pip install Sphinx
$ cd doc
$ make html
```
